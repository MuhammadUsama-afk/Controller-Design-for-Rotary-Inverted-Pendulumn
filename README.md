# Controller-Design-for-Rotary-Inverted-Pendulumn

We aim to design a controller for a non-linear system in order to meet the proposed design requirements, while ensuring stability. Now to solve this problem, we will be using classic as well as modern approaches to meet the design requirements. We will also verify the effectiveness of designed controller on MATLAB and show the results. We will set the constraints ourselves for the ease of demonstration.
